1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
I've always secretly wanted to be a machine.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.190
I felt like if I was a machine I'd never

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.490
let things fall through the cracks.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.990
I wouldn't forget things and I do everything I needed

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.690
to do on time.

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.790
Every time I knew there were people out there that

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.490
were like this and I want to know what makes

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.690
them tick.

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.490
So a few years ago,

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.890
I started a newsletter called Super Organizers where I

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.290
profiled 50 of the top performers in a variety of

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.590
fields.

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.090
I've talked to managers who track everything they do

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.490
in a day

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.190
in 15 minute increments,

16
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.490
I've talked to investors who keep spreadsheets of every single

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.090
person they've ever met, I've talked to CEOs,

18
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.790
who keep their calendars basically empty and rarely ever do

19
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.590
meetings like ever.

20
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.890
I've also experimented with a lot of hacks myself to

21
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.190
try to get me closer to my ideal.

22
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.990
I've taped my mouth shut while I'm sleeping and stared

23
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.290
at the sunlamp

24
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.690
to increase my energy levels.

25
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.390
I visualized my compassionate self and tried all sorts

26
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.290
of supplements to hack

27
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.390
my body chemistry. Sometimes the things I try work and

28
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.990
sometimes they don't,

29
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.190
sometimes they're just kind of ridiculous,

30
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.390
but I want to share with you the best trick

31
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.790
I've learned in all of my exploring,

32
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.890
the idea of being a machine is actually a trap.

33
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.190
It gets in the way of our productivity because it

34
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.490
makes us blind to the roots of our actual problem.

35
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.390
We are not machines, we're emotional beings. And learning to

36
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.690
skillfully recognize and work

37
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090
with our emotions is the only way to actually be

38
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.690
productive day-to-day.

39
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.590
Guilt, shame, fear, so often they're at the base of what's going on

40
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.390
for us in ways that we barely understand. What's underneath our productivity

41
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.890
problems isn't just a need for a new tool or system,

42
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.890
but something going on in our emotional lives. And being

43
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.290
aware of

44
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.490
and observing how our emotions can affect us

45
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.590
can open you a lot of flexibility and freedom to

46
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.990
make progress

47
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.390
when we'd otherwise be stuck,

48
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.790
I found that the most productive people in the world,

49
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.290
you know,

50
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.290
the ones who are most machine,

51
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.790
like,

52
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.790
actually recognize this and they often do three things to

53
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.290
work with it.

54
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.190
They're aware when they have a problem, they observe what's going on

55
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.990
without judgement.

56
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.190
So they can understand it and they keep experimenting with

57
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.790
systems or teams, mindsets and tools until it changes.

58
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.990
This might seem simple and it is,

59
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.890
but it's actually very hard to do.

60
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.790
Because at each stage

61
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.890
we get blocked in twisted up by the shame and

62
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.790
fear and doubt,

63
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.490
the things that get in the way of seeing things

64
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.890
clearly. To do this well,

65
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.690
requires a level of emotional Mastery that is very difficult

66
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.290
to practice.

67
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.290
So let me walk you through it and show you how

68
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.590
it can work,

69
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.990
Awareness is the first step. That means being aware of

70
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.390
problems in your productivity,

71
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.390
but that's harder than it

72
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.390
seems. No matter what the issue is,

73
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.790
it's much easier to ignore it and hope that

74
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.690
it goes away than to admit

75
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.390
that something is wrong.

76
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.790
We feel like we should be able to just do

77
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.390
better. We feel like, well, that's the job,

78
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.390
I should just suck it up.

79
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.990
Whatever the problems that you're encountering in your productivity,

80
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.590
you might not think about them that often because

81
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.690
it's pretty painful,

82
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.190
but there's magic in becoming aware of the problems that

83
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.890
we're ordinarily

84
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.890
not aware of. The most productive people have regular practices

85
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.590
that they use to maintain that awareness. Sometimes it's journaling,

86
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.890
sometimes it mindfulness,

87
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.090
sometimes it's just a walk,

88
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.690
sometimes it's therapy.

89
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.490
But everyone has something. Here's an example from my own life.

90
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.890
I have a ton of trouble staying on top of

91
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.490
my inbox. I'm the CEO of a startup and so

92
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.090
this was really hard for me to admit at first.

93
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.290
It seemed like an indictment of me and my ability

94
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.290
to be successful if my inbox was a mess.

95
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.390
But last year after a lot of reflection,

96
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.490
I realized that I had to face the fact that

97
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.690
the backlog was causing problems throughout my company.

98
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.890
Once I was aware of the problem,

99
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.990
I can start the next step: observation.

100
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.090
When I moved into the observation stage,

101
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.290
I wanted to see with as little judgment as

102
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.690
possible

103
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.790
what usually leads to my inbox being crowded?

104
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.890
Observing with that judgment was really difficult for me.

105
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.590
My sense of doubt and fear came up.

106
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.590
I thought: Should I really need to do this?

107
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.390
I really felt like I should just be able to

108
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.690
get to my inbox without any problems but once I

109
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.890
got beneath that I began to notice something really surprising.

110
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.090
There were actually many periods where I was on top

111
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.490
of my inbox.

112
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.990
It's just that every couple of weeks there would be a shift

113
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.290
where it would just turn into a giant mess.

114
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.390
And it had a very specific trigger, either a single

115
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.590
email that I really didn't want to deal with or

116
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.490
a really busy period

117
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.090
in my life where I couldn't look at my inbox

118
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.490
for a day or two.

119
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.290
And when this happened, emails will start to pile up

120
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.090
and I'd start to feel shame. I'd avoid my inbox

121
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.090
and the pile would just get way worse.

122
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.190
It was a vicious cycle.

123
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.390
Once I saw this,

124
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.490
I realized there was a logical place to intervene,

125
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.890
What I really needed to do was to catch myself right

126
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.490
at the point every couple of weeks where my clean inbox

127
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.290
was turning into a mess.

128
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.390
And if I could do that,

129
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.190
I knew I could keep it clean the rest of

130
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.490
the time.

131
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.590
This brings us to the next step: experimentation.

132
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.590
Once productive

133
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.190
people have recognized the problem and observed its contours

134
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.790
without judgment.

135
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.990
they try new solutions to find out what works.

136
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.990
Again, this can be really easy to get twisted up about.

137
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.190
We're all filled with preconceptions about what's in and out

138
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.390
of bounds to experiment with,

139
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.190
and we're really boxed in by those preconceptions.

140
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.190
We don't wanna look silly. We don't wanna look

141
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.490
weak.

142
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.590
But if we allow ourselves to find what works for

143
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.790
us,

144
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.590
we often find things that no one else would.

145
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.390
For me,

146
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.290
I tried a lot of different experiments to deal with

147
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.090
my inbox problems.

148
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.590
I tried going to a new coffee shop

149
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.190
every time I needed to power through some emails.

150
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.290
So I tried talking about it with my business partner

151
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.390
and other people at my company to try to lower

152
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.390
my sense of Shame about it.

153
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.990
I tried a OneTouch email strategy.

154
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.490
I tried only checking my e-mail twice a day but

155
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.390
none of these really solved the problem completely.

156
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.790
So I kept going and I had a big insight,

157
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.290
I figured out that I might be able to use

158
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.090
my own desire

159
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.790
not to let people down to help me get through

160
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.190
my inbox.

161
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.490
I'm lucky enough to split a virtual assistant with my

162
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.890
business partner.

163
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.090
So I wondered,

164
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.790
what if I put an hour,

165
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.390
on my calendar,

166
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.390
a few times a week where they would babysit me

167
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.890
at the beginning of the hour,

168
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.690
they'd message me and ask me how many emails I

169
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.490
had in my inbox and at the end of the

170
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.590
hour,

171
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.090
they'd message me again to ask how

172
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.290
many I'd gotten done.

173
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.890
I used my virtual assistant but you can use anyone

174
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.090
in your life,

175
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.590
a family member or friend who struggles with something similar and

176
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.090
propose a trade.

177
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.490
It literally takes a couple of seconds to message back and forth.

178
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.990
When I started to consider this, my immediate reaction was shame.

179
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.490
I felt like I should not need a babysitter to

180
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.190
do my work and I dreaded the conversation where I

181
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.190
had to ask for this kind of thing.

182
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.390
I also dreaded admitting it to anyone else.

183
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.090
It all seemed very,

184
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.590
very silly but I decided to try it anyway and it

185
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.190
turns out just that little interaction a few times a

186
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.290
week,

187
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.990
makes a gigantic difference for me. Getting a message

188
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.790
from my assistant keeps me on task on my email

189
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.390
and prevents the piles from being created

190
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.590
which makes it really easy for me to keep

191
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.790
my inbox clean at every other time.

192
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.790
And now I'm sitting here almost a year later with

193
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.490
a clean inbox on a consistent basis.

194
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.390
This may not work for you but it does work

195
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.690
for me.

196
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.190
You might find that other approaches are better, like transferring

197
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.090
your emails to your to-do list or making sure you're

198
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.290
following a OneTouch inbox strategy or maybe even examining

199
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.590
why you need to get through your inbox in the

200
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.690
first place but the only way to find out is

201
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.290
to try it.

202
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.390
What I've realized in all of my exploring is that I actually didn't

203
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.090
really ever want to be a machine.

204
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.990
I just felt guilty and ashamed for not being one.

205
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.990
And once I started to work with that,

206
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.590
everything changed for me,

207
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.790
We think productivity is about software and notebooks and to-do

208
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.890
lists

209
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.390
frameworks and calendars,

210
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.390
and schedules and inboxes,

211
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.090
and it is all of those things.

212
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.190
But it's also about our brains and our bodies. It is

213
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.690
about our emotions and how they guide us.

214
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.790
And sometimes get in our way.

215
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.190
If you turn over the rock of productivity,

216
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.190
you can find a lot hiding underneath. Identifying what's there

217
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.690
is the best productivity hack

218
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.190
I know.
